# Workflow that runs our basic build and tests.
#
# Most jobs depend on the python_build_and_push job, which builds the Python Docker images, then
# pushes them to ECR (or updates the ECR images with the latest git commit SHA). Subsequent jobs
# then pull these cached images from ECR.
#
# The ECR steps use credentials for the github-cicd user in AWS.
# See https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials
# and https://github.com/aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login
