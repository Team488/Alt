    Goals for this class
    
    This class will be the sole output to every other system. So any calls that are inputted by core input will be processed then sent out throught here
    This includes but is not limited to, movement vectors for the robot, coordinates for various things(Highest note etc), A view of the map, etc

    All the methods in this class should do minimal processing, just take in the data core input sends after mapinternals has done all its magic, then spit it out back over the network
