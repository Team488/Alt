"""
XDash Operator Module - Interface to the XDash visualization dashboard

This module provides an interface to the XDash visualization dashboard, allowing
system telemetry and state information to be displayed to operators. It handles
sending periodic updates of probability maps, path planning information, detection
results, and other visualization data needed for effective operation.

The XDashOperator serves as the bridge between the robot's internal state and
the operator dashboard by:
- Converting internal data structures to dashboard-compatible formats
- Periodically publishing updates to ensure the dashboard stays current
- Managing the network communication with the dashboard application

This enables operators to:
- Visualize probability maps showing likely object locations
- See planned paths and trajectories
- Monitor system status and performance metrics
- Make informed decisions based on visual feedback
