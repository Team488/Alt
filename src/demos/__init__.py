Demos Package - Demonstration and testing applications

This package contains standalone demonstration applications that showcase
various capabilities of the system. These demos are useful for testing
individual components, visualizing algorithm behavior, and providing
educational examples.

Key components include:
- Path planning demonstrations (A*, dynamic planning)
- Probability map visualizations and interactions
- State estimation with UKF and particle filters
- Reef tracking and AprilTag demonstrations
- Simulated robot and environment demos
- Utility functions shared across demo applications

The demos are designed to be run individually to test specific features
or as educational tools to understand how different algorithms work in
controlled environments.
