"""
Path Planning Package - Navigation and path generation algorithms

This package provides a collection of algorithms and utilities for robot path planning,
collision avoidance, and navigation. It implements various pathfinding approaches and
supporting data structures.

Key components include:
- A* pathfinding for efficient navigation around obstacles
- Grid-based world representation for discretized planning
- Bezier curve path smoothing for natural robot movement
- Path optimization to minimize distance and energy
- Helper utilities for converting between coordinate systems
- Fast marching methods for advanced path planning

The path planning system works with obstacle maps to generate safe, efficient paths
for the robot to follow, supporting both autonomous navigation and interactive
path selection.
